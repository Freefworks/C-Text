Super Mario 2000 Status Update

As it currently stands, the levels for this project are fully complete.
I will eventually put all of these levels into a full game when a future update for Mario Builder 64 allows me to.
I may also create new levels if the maximum star count for a game can exceed 64.
I would love to have Eye-rok as a boss fight, but we'll see.
No promises, okay?
